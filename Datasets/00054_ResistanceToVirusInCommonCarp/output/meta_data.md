# Mapping and Sequencing of a Significant Quantitative Trait Locus Affecting Resistance to Koi Herpesvirus in Common Carp

This publication discusses the Cyprinids are the most highly produced group of fishes globally, with common carp being one of the most valuable species of the group. Koi herpesvirus (KHV) infections can result in high levels of mortality, causing major economic losses, and is listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health. Selective breeding for host resistance has the potential to reduce morbidity and losses due to KHV. Therefore, improving knowledge about host resistance and methods of incorporating genomic data into breeding for resistance may contribute to a decrease in economic losses in carp farming. In the current study, a population of 1,425 carp juveniles, originating from a factorial cross between 40 sires and 20 dams was challenged with KHV. Mortalities and survivors were recorded and sampled for genotyping by sequencing using Restriction Site-Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). Genome-wide association analyses were performed to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance to KHV. A genome-wide significant QTL affecting resistance to KHV was identified on linkage group 44, explaining approximately 7% of the additive genetic variance. Pooled whole genome resequencing of a subset of resistant (n = 60) and susceptible animals (n = 60) was performed to characterize QTL regions, including identification of putative candidate genes and functional annotation of associated polymorphisms. The TRIM25 gene was identified as a promising positional and functional candidate within the QTL region of LG 44, and a putative premature stop mutation in this gene was discovered.
It contains  genotypes and  markers.
