# Miscanthus sinensis multi-location trial: phenotypic analysis, genome-wide association, and genomic prediction

This publication discusses the This dataset contains genotypic and phenotypic data, R scripts, and the results of analysis pertaining to a multi-location field trial of Miscanthus sinensis. Genome-wide association and genomic prediction were performed for biomass yield and 14 yield-component traits across six field trial locations in Asia and North America, using 46,177 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers mined from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and 568 M. sinensis accessions. Genomic regions and candidate genes were identified that can be used for breeding improved varieties of M. sinensis, which in turn will be used to generate new M. xgiganteus clones for biomass.
It contains  genotypes and  markers.
