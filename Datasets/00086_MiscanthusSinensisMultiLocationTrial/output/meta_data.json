Genome-wide association and genomic prediction were performed for biomass yield and 14 yield-component traits across six field trial locations in Asia and North America, using 46,177 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers mined from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and 568 M. sinensis accessions. Genomic regions and candidate genes were identified that can be used for breeding improved varieties of M. sinensis, which in turn will be used to generate new M. xgiganteus clones for biomass.","Scientific_Name":"Miscanthus sinensis","Common_Name":"Chinese silver grass","Sharing_Link":"https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-1182845","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":true,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":594,"N_markers":46177,"Download_Instructions":"Read README file and download required files.","Tags":"genomics; phenotypics; genome-wide association study; genomic prediction; Miscanthus sinensis; single-nucleotide polymorphism; biomass yield; breeding improvement"}
