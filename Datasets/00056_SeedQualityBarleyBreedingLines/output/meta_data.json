The objective of this study was to develop genomic prediction for important seed quality parameters in spring barley. The aim was to predict breeding values without expensive phenotyping of large sets of lines. A total number of 309 advanced spring barley lines tested at two locations each with three replicates were phenotyped and each line was genotyped by Illumina iSelect 9Kbarley chip. The population originated from two different breeding sets, which were phenotyped in two different years. Phenotypic measurements considered were: seed size, protein content, protein yield, test weight and ergosterol content. A leave-one-out cross-validation strategy revealed high prediction accuracies ranging between 0.40 and 0.83. Prediction across breeding sets resulted in reduced accuracies compared to the leave-one-out strategy. Furthermore, predicting across full and half-sib-families resulted in reduced prediction accuracies. Additionally, predictions were performed using reduced marker sets and reduced training population sets. In conclusion, using less than 200 lines in the training set can result in low prediction accuracy, and the accuracy will then be highly dependent on the family structure of the selected training set. However, the results also indicate that relatively small training sets (200 lines) are sufficient for genomic prediction in commercial barley breeding. In addition, our results indicate a minimum marker set of 1,000 to decrease the risk of low prediction accuracy for some traits or some families","Scientific_Name":"Hordeum vulgare","Common_Name":"Barley","Sharing_Link":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Genomic_Prediction_of_Seed_Quality_Traits_Using_Advanced_Barley_Breeding_Lines/4107978","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":true,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":309,"N_markers":7864,"Download_Instructions":"NA","Tags":"genomic selection; plant breeding; barley; seed quality; phenotyping; genotyping; prediction accuracy; cross-validation"}
