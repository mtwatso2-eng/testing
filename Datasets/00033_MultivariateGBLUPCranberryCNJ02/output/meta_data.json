The exploitation of genome-assisted approaches could greatly benefit breeding efforts in American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) and other minor crops. Using biparental populations with different degrees of relatedness, we evaluated multiple GS methods for total yield (TY) and mean fruit weight (MFW). Specifically, we compared predictive ability (PA) differences between univariate and multivariate genomic best linear unbiased predictors (GBLUP and MGBLUP, respectively). We found that MGBLUP provided higher predictive ability (PA) than GBLUP, in scenarios with medium genetic correlation (8\u201317% increase with corg~0.6) and high genetic correlations (25\u2013156% with corg~0.9), but found no increase when genetic correlation was low. In addition, we found that only a few hundred single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are needed to reach a plateau in PA for both traits in the biparental populations studied (in full linkage disequilibrium). We observed that higher resemblance among individuals in the training (TP) and validation (VP) populations provided greater PA. Although multivariate GS methods are available, genetic correlations and other factors need to be carefully considered when applying these methods for genetic improvement.","Scientific_Name":"Vaccinium macrocarpon","Common_Name":"American Cranberry","Sharing_Link":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.01310/full#supplementary-material","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":true,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":178,"N_markers":3754,"Download_Instructions":"Go to Supplementary Material of the article and Download SF1 file(Table 1)","Tags":"genomic selection; GWAS; genetic correlations; plant breeding; predictive ability; SNP markers; multivariate analysis; Vaccinium macrocarpon"}
