Traditionally, structure has been dealt with as a potential confounder, and various methods exist to \u201ccorrect\u201d for population stratification. However, these methods induce a mean correction that does not account for heterogeneity of marker effects. The animal breeding literature offers a few recent studies that consider modeling genetic heterogeneity in multibreed data, using multivariate models. However, these methods have received little attention in plant breeding where population structure can have different forms. In this article we address the problem of analyzing data from heterogeneous plant breeding populations, using three approaches: (a) a model that ignores population structure [A-genome-based best linear unbiased prediction (A-GBLUP)], (b) a stratified (i.e., within-group) analysis (W-GBLUP), and (c) a multivariate approach that uses multigroup data and accounts for heterogeneity (MG-GBLUP). The performance of the three models was assessed on three different data sets: a diversity panel of rice (Oryza sativa), a maize (Zea mays L.) half-sib panel, and a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) data set that originated from plant breeding programs. The estimated genomic correlations between subpopulations varied from null to moderate, depending on the genetic distance between subpopulations and traits. Our assessment of prediction accuracy features cases where ignoring population structure leads to a parsimonious more powerful model as well as others where the multivariate and stratified approaches have higher predictive power. In general, the multivariate approach appeared slightly more robust than either the A- or the W-GBLUP.","Scientific_Name":"Zea mays","Common_Name":"Maize","Sharing_Link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE50558","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":false,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":1005,"N_markers":56110,"Download_Instructions":"To download the data used in the article - Scroll down and Find CFD matrix file(Dent Populations)","Tags":"plant breeding; population structure; genetic heterogeneity; genomic prediction; multivariate models; marker effects; predictive modeling; admixture"}
