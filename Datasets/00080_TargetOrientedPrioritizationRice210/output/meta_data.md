# Target-oriented prioritization: targeted selection strategy by integrating organismal and molecular traits through predictive analytics in breeding

This publication discusses the Folder Data_TOP contains four sets of data, NCII, Maize 368 , Maize 282 and Rice 210, used in the article entitled "Target-Oriented Prioritization: targeted selection strategy by integrating organismal and molecular traits through predictive analytics in breeding". The maize NCII population consists of 5,820 F1 hybrids with 156,269 SNPs and 18 agronomic traits. Maize 368 was characterized with 100K SNPs, 20 agronomic traits and 749 metabolic traits. Maize 282 was genotyped with 50878 SNPs and phenotyped for 21 agronomic traits and 37127 transcriptomic traits from seven tissues. The Rice 210 dataset consists of 1619 bins, 4 agronomic traits, 24,994 gene expressions, and 1000 metabolic traits.
It contains  genotypes and  markers.
