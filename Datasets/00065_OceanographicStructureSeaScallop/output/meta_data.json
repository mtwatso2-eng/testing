We used 7163 SNPs derived from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing genotyped in 245 individuals of the economically important sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, to evaluate the correlations between oceanographic variation and a previously identified latitudinal genomic cline. Sea scallops span a broad latitudinal area (>10 degrees), and we hypothesized that climatic variation significantly drives clinal trends in allele frequency. Using a large environmental dataset, including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, and nutrient concentrations, we identified a suite of SNPs (285\u2013621, depending on analysis and environmental dataset) potentially under selection through correlations with environmental variation. Principal components analysis of different outlier SNPs and environmental datasets revealed similar northern and southern clusters, with significant associations between the first axes of each (R2adj = .66\u2013.79). Multivariate redundancy analysis of outlier SNPs and the environmental principal components indicated that environmental factors explained more than 32% of the variance. Similarly, multiple linear regressions and random-forest analysis identified winter average and minimum ocean temperatures as significant parameters in the link between genetic and environmental variation. This work indicates that oceanographic variation is associated with the observed genomic cline in this species and that seasonal periods of extreme cold may restrict gene flow along a latitudinal gradient in this marine benthic bivalve. Incorporating this finding into management may improve accuracy of management strategies and future predictions.","Scientific_Name":"Placopecten magellanicus","Common_Name":"Atlantic sea scallop","Sharing_Link":"https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.c15v5","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":true,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":245,"N_markers":7216,"Download_Instructions":"NA","Tags":"marine biodiversity; population genetics; environmental impact; fisheries management; genomic analysis; oceanographic variation; climate change effects; molecular ecology"}
