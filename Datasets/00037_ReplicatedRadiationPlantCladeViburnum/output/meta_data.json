Several cases have been described in animals, but in plants we lack well-documented cases of replicated radiation that combine comprehensive phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses, the delimitation of geographic areas within which a set of \u2018ecomorphs\u2019 evolved independently and the identification of potential underlying mechanisms. Here we document the repeated evolution of a set of leaf ecomorphs in a group of neotropical plants. The Oreinotinus lineage within the angiosperm clade Viburnum spread from Mexico to Argentina through disjunct cloud forest environments. In 9 of 11 areas of endemism, species with similar sets of leaf forms evolved in parallel. We reject gene-flow-mediated evolution of similar leaves and show, instead, that species with disparate leaf forms differ in their climatic niches, supporting ecological adaptation as the driver of parallelism. Our identification of a case of replicated radiation in plants sets the stage for comparative analyses of such phenomena across the tree of life.","Scientific_Name":"Viburnum sp","Common_Name":"Viburnum","Sharing_Link":"https://zenodo.org/records/5504439","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":true,"Map":true,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":273,"N_markers":3419673,"Download_Instructions":"NA","Tags":"parallel evolution; replicated radiation; ecological adaptation; phylogenetic analysis; biogeography; ecomorphs; neotropical plants; Viburnum"}
