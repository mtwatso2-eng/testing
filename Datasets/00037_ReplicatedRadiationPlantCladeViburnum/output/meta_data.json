Several cases have been described in animals, but in plants we lack well-documented cases of replicated radiation that combine comprehensive phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses, the delimitation of geographic areas within which a set of ‘ecomorphs’ evolved independently and the identification of potential underlying mechanisms. Here we document the repeated evolution of a set of leaf ecomorphs in a group of neotropical plants. The Oreinotinus lineage within the angiosperm clade Viburnum spread from Mexico to Argentina through disjunct cloud forest environments. In 9 of 11 areas of endemism, species with similar sets of leaf forms evolved in parallel. We reject gene-flow-mediated evolution of similar leaves and show, instead, that species with disparate leaf forms differ in their climatic niches, supporting ecological adaptation as the driver of parallelism. Our identification of a case of replicated radiation in plants sets the stage for comparative analyses of such phenomena across the tree of life."],"Scientific_Name":["Viburnum sp"],"Common_Name":["Viburnum"],"Sharing_Link":["https://zenodo.org/records/5504439"],"Requires_Authorization":[false],"Phenotype":[true],"Map":[true],"Pedigree":[false],"N_Geno":[273],"N_markers":[3419673],"Download_Instructions":[null],"Tags":["parallel evolution; replicated radiation; ecological adaptation; phylogenetic analysis; biogeography; ecomorphs; neotropical plants; Viburnum"]}
