Thus, 29 training sets (TSs) were defined considering three diversity panels: the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP\u2014validation set (VS)) and the ASSO and USDA North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS) (external public panels\u2014predictors), which were divided into four scenarios with different TS configurations. We showed that it is possible to use public datasets as a primary TS and that population structure can modify the predictive abilities of GS. In the four scenarios proposed, very large or very small sets did not provide predictive abilities over 0.53 for GS. However, OTSs composed of 250 individuals were sufficient to achieve predictive abilities over this limit.","Scientific_Name":"Zea mays","Common_Name":"Maize","Sharing_Link":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Predicting_tropical_maize_inbred_lines_with_external_panels_from_public_dataset/5525263/2","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":true,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":2749,"N_markers":28258,"Download_Instructions":"NA","Tags":"genomic prediction; tropical maize; phenotypic data; population structure; training sets; predictive ability; genetic values; public databases"}
