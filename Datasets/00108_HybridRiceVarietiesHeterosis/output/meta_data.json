However, the genetic mechanisms of heterosis are only partly understood, and a global view of heterosis from a representative number of hybrid combinations is lacking. Here we develop an integrated genomic approach to construct a genome map for 1,495 elite hybrid rice varieties and their inbred parental lines. We investigate 38 agronomic traits and identify 130 associated loci. In-depth analyses of the effects of heterozygous genotypes reveal that there are only a few loci with strong overdominance effects in hybrids, but a strong correlation is observed between the yield and the number of superior alleles. While most parental inbred lines have only a small number of superior alleles, high-yielding hybrid varieties have several. We conclude that the accumulation of numerous rare superior alleles with positive dominance is an important contributor to the heterotic phenomena.","Scientific_Name":"Oryza sativa","Common_Name":"Rice","Sharing_Link":"http://db.ncgr.ac.cn/RiceHap4/","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":false,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":1495,"N_markers":1654030,"Download_Instructions":"Download all the indica and japonica files","Tags":"heterosis; genetics in agriculture; hybrid rice varieties; genomic approach; agronomic traits; overdominance effects; superior alleles; genetic mechanisms"}
