Emerging approaches based on genomic, climatic and anthropogenic data provide a promising analytical framework to address this question. This study applied such an integrative approach to examine potential drivers for the endangerment of the green peafowl (Pavo muticus). Several demographic reconstructions based on population genomes congruently retrieved a drastic population declination since the mid-Holocene. Furthermore, a comparison between historical and modern genomes suggested genetic diversity decrease during the last 50 years. However, climate-based ecological niche models predicted stationary general range during these periods and imply the little impact of climate change. Further analyses suggested that human disturbance intensities were negatively correlated with the green peafowl's effective population sizes and significantly associated with its survival status (extirpation or persistence). Archaeological and historical records corroborate the critical role of humans, leaving the footprint of low genomic diversity and high inbreeding in the survival populations. This study sheds light on the potential deep-time effects of human disturbance on species endangerment and offers a multi-evidential approach in examining underlying forces for population declines.","Scientific_Name":"Pavo muticus","Common_Name":"Green Peafowl","Sharing_Link":"https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.ffbg79ctc","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":false,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":22,"N_markers":1139469,"Download_Instructions":"NA","Tags":"genomics; species extinction; climate change; anthropogenic impacts; ecological niche modeling; conservation biology; population genetics; biodiversity loss"}
