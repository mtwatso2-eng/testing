The remaining two original objectives will be met in the next year, as the analyses are completed and papers published: 5) Switchgrass population structure and germplasm diversity will be evaluated; and 6) Association mapping will be established and marker based breeding values estimated in switchgrass. We also completed a study of the chromosome-number variation found in switchgrass.","Scientific_Name":"Panicum virgatum","Common_Name":"Switchgrass","Sharing_Link":"https://datacommons.cyverse.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/panzea/genotypes/GBS/switchgrass/Lu_PLoSGenet_2013_switchgrassGenos20150612.zip","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":false,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":167,"N_markers":476005,"Download_Instructions":"NA","Tags":"switchgrass research; genetic mapping; biofeedstock characteristics; SNP markers; plant genetics; agricultural genomics; crop diversity; association mapping"}
