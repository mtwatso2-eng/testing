When adequately robust genomic prediction models are available, an additional increase in genetic gains can be made possible with the shortening of the breeding cycle through elimination of the progeny testing phase and early selection of parental candidates. The potential of genomic selection was investigated in an advanced Eucalyptus nitens breeding population focused on improvement for solid wood production. A high-density SNP chip (EUChip60K) was used to genotype 691 individuals in the breeding population, which represented two seed orchards with different selection histories. Phenotypic records for growth and form traits at age six, and for wood quality traits at age seven were available to build genomic prediction models using GBLUP, which were compared to the traditional pedigree-based alternative using BLUP. GBLUP demonstrated that breeding value accuracy would be improved and substantial increases in genetic gains towards solid wood production would be achieved. Cross-validation within and across two different seed orchards indicated that genomic predictions would likely benefit in terms of higher predictive accuracy from increasing the size of the training data sets through higher relatedness and better utilization of LD","Scientific_Name":"Eucalyptus nitens","Common_Name":"Shining gum","Sharing_Link":"https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.pf58510","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":true,"Map":true,"Pedigree":true,"N_Geno":691,"N_markers":64640,"Download_Instructions":"NA","Tags":"genomic selection; forest tree breeding; Eucalyptus nitens; SNP chip; genomic prediction models; genetic gains; GBLUP; marker-based relationship matrices"}
