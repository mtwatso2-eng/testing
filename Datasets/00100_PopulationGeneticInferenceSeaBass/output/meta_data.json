The spotted sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) is a non-model species of ecological and commercial importance and widely distributed in northwestern Pacific. A total of 22 648 SNPs was discovered across the genome of L. maculatus by paired-end sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-PE) for 30 individuals from two populations. The nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) for each population was 0.0028\u00b10.0001 in Dandong and 0.0018\u00b10.0001 in Beihai, respectively. Shallow but significant genetic differentiation was detected between the two populations analyzed by using both the whole data set (FST = 0.0550, P < 0.001) and the putatively neutral SNPs (FST = 0.0347, P < 0.001). However, the two populations were highly differentiated based on the putatively adaptive SNPs (FST = 0.6929, P < 0.001). Moreover, a total of 356 SNPs representing 298 unique loci were detected as outliers putatively under divergent selection by FST-based outlier tests as implemented in BAYESCAN and LOSITAN. Functional annotation of the contigs containing putatively adaptive SNPs yielded hits for 22 of 55 (40%) significant BLASTX matches. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including binding, catalytic and metabolic activities, etc. The analyses with the SNPs developed in the present study highlighted the importance of genome-wide genetic variation for inference of population structure and local adaptation in L. maculatus.","Scientific_Name":"Lateolabrax maculatus","Common_Name":"Spotted sea bass","Sharing_Link":"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Genome-Wide_SNP_Discovery_Genotyping_and_Their_Preliminary_Applications_for_Population_Genetic_Inference_in_Spotted_Sea_Bass_i_Lateolabrax_maculatus_i_/3460751?file=5441483","Requires_Authorization":false,"Phenotype":false,"Map":false,"Pedigree":false,"N_Geno":30,"N_markers":22648,"Download_Instructions":"NA","Tags":"next-generation sequencing; single-nucleotide polymorphisms; population genetic structure; genomic selection; spotted sea bass; RAD-PE sequencing; genetic differentiation; local adaptation"}
