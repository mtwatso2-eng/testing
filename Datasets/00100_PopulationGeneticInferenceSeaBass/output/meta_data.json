The spotted sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) is a non-model species of ecological and commercial importance and widely distributed in northwestern Pacific. A total of 22 648 SNPs was discovered across the genome of L. maculatus by paired-end sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-PE) for 30 individuals from two populations. The nucleotide diversity (π) for each population was 0.0028±0.0001 in Dandong and 0.0018±0.0001 in Beihai, respectively. Shallow but significant genetic differentiation was detected between the two populations analyzed by using both the whole data set (FST = 0.0550, P < 0.001) and the putatively neutral SNPs (FST = 0.0347, P < 0.001). However, the two populations were highly differentiated based on the putatively adaptive SNPs (FST = 0.6929, P < 0.001). Moreover, a total of 356 SNPs representing 298 unique loci were detected as outliers putatively under divergent selection by FST-based outlier tests as implemented in BAYESCAN and LOSITAN. Functional annotation of the contigs containing putatively adaptive SNPs yielded hits for 22 of 55 (40%) significant BLASTX matches. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including binding, catalytic and metabolic activities, etc. The analyses with the SNPs developed in the present study highlighted the importance of genome-wide genetic variation for inference of population structure and local adaptation in L. maculatus."],"Scientific_Name":["Lateolabrax maculatus"],"Common_Name":["Spotted sea bass"],"Sharing_Link":["https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Genome-Wide_SNP_Discovery_Genotyping_and_Their_Preliminary_Applications_for_Population_Genetic_Inference_in_Spotted_Sea_Bass_i_Lateolabrax_maculatus_i_/3460751?file=5441483"],"Requires_Authorization":[false],"Phenotype":[false],"Map":[false],"Pedigree":[false],"N_Geno":[30],"N_markers":[22648],"Download_Instructions":[null],"Tags":["next-generation sequencing; single-nucleotide polymorphisms; population genetic structure; genomic selection; spotted sea bass; RAD-PE sequencing; genetic differentiation; local adaptation"]}
